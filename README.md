- 👋 Hi, I’m @VictorDesloges, a PhD Student
- 👀 I’m interested in civil engineering, physical sciences and of course computer things
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Fortran, Medit, GiD, and others stuffs
- 💌 I’m looking to collaborate on the development of programs on the boundary element method
- 💻 I'm currently working at the ICube Laboratory (UMR7357) in the Civil Engineering & Energetics Team, in Strasbourg - France
- 👨‍🎓 I'm a graduate of the École Centrale de Lyon (general engineering degree) since 2019
- 🙇‍♂️ I am curious, so I also have a master's degree in philosophy from the University Lyon 3 (ethics, ecology and sustainable development)
- 👨‍🏫 I'm a teacher of physics-chemistry, continuum mechanics and numerical analysis at the INSA Strasbourg engineering school
- 🚧 My thesis is about : "Study and modeling of cracking of asphalt concrete under dynamic loads using boundary elements method"
